This ROS package serves the purpose of parsing the rosbag files obtained from the SCAND dataset that contain social navigation data

To execute the package, follow the instructions below:

1. Navigate to the directory "path/to/scandparser/src".
2. Run the "run.sh" script with the parameters "rosbag_dir=/path/to/rosbags" and "save_dir=/path/to/save_dir".
The script will create a folder in the "save_dir" location with the name of the rosbag file that was parsed.
